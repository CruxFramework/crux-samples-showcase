				<p>
					Birds (class Aves or clade Avialae) are feathered, winged, two-legged, warm-blooded, egg-laying vertebrates. 
					Modern birds are characterised by feathers, a beak with no teeth, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high 
					metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Extant birds have more or less 
					developed wings; the most recent species without wings was the moa, which is generally considered to have become 
					extinct in the 16th century. Wings are evolved forelimbs, and most bird species can fly. Flightless birds include 
					ratites, penguins, and diverse endemic island species.
